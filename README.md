# Selenium with Python Automation

This is a growing collection of Selenium scripts written in Python. It includes patterns, test snippets, and curated resources based on real testing work.

The goal is not to teach from scratch but to provide something practical that can actually help when you're stuck or just need a quick reference. Whether you're writing your first Selenium test or dealing with flaky waits, there's something here that might save your time.

## What you will find here

- Clean scripts for common test scenarios  
- Working examples using different locator strategies  
- Sample tests using Pytest and Unittest  
- Real world automation examples on public sites  
- A few links to useful videos and articles that are actually worth clicking

## Why this repo exists

Most Selenium examples online either go too deep into theory or are scattered and inconsistent. This repo keeps things simple and focused on what you actually need when writing or debugging tests.

No unnecessary abstractions. Just working examples that make sense.

## Contributions

If you have something that you feel can help the community in learning something new, feel free to raise a PR. You can also contribute useful links, videos, or articles that saved your time. Doesn’t have to be code only.

This is meant to be a growing, practical collection for testers. The kind you wish you had bookmarked earlier.
