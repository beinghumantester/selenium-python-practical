**Behave Official Documentation**

If someone is planning to work with Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in Python, then Behave is one of the most widely used frameworks. It allows us to write tests in plain language (Gherkin syntax), making it easier for both technical and non-technical people to understand the scenarios being tested.

Below are the two official documentation sources you should always refer to:


**1. Behave GitHub Repository**

ðŸ”— https://github.com/behave/behave

Contains the official source code for Behave.

We will find release notes, issue tracking, and contributions from the community.

Useful if you want to check latest changes, versions, or report a bug.


**2. Behave ReadTheDocs Documentation**

ðŸ”— https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This is the primary reference for learning and using Behave.

Covers installation, setup, writing feature files, step definitions, and advanced configurations.

Includes practical examples and explanation of Gherkin syntax.

**Why Both**

-Use ReadTheDocs when you want to learn how to use Behave step by step.

-Use the GitHub Repo when you need technical details, want to explore the source code, or check for updates/issues.

-> Tip: Bookmark both links. ReadTheDocs will help you learn, while GitHub keeps you updated on the latest developments.
