# Python Documentation

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is one of the most popular languages in the world, powering everything from web applications and automation scripts to data science and artificial intelligence.

If you are working with Selenium or any other testing frameworks in this repository, Python is the foundation underneath. To make the most of it, here are the official resources you should always keep bookmarked.
