# Pytest Official Documentation

If anyone is working with Python test automation, **pytest** is the de facto framework for writing clean, readable tests. It scales effortlesslyâ€”from simple assertions to full-blown test suites with fixtures and plugins.

Here are the official reference points:

---

### 1. Pytest GitHub Repository  
ðŸ”— https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest

This is where the backbone of pytest lives:
- Browse the source code, check out latest changes and pull requests, and track issues.
- Great for keeping tabs on updates, inspecting fixes, or even contributing back.

---

### 2. Pytest Page on PyPI  
ðŸ”— https://pypi.org/project/pytest/

- The official package listing. Shows current version, dependencies, and release history. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- Handy if someone is installing via pip or want metadata on compatibility (e.g., Python 3.9+). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 3. Pytest Stable Documentation  
ðŸ”— https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/

- This is our go-to for learning how to use pytest.
- Covers everything you need:
  - Getting started and installation
  - Writing your first tests, shared fixtures, parameterization
  - Plugin architecture, configuration, and advanced features :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Learn pytest syntax and workflow     | Read the official documentation        |
| Install or check package details     | Check the PyPI page                    |
| Track updates or inspect code        | Browse the GitHub repo                 |

**Quick Tip:** Always have the docs open when testing or experimenting with fixtures and plugins. It beats combing through StackOverflow for syntax that might be outdated.
